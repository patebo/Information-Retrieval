      "The immunogenic and antigenic determinants of a synthetic peptide and the corresponding antigenic determinants in the parent protein have been elucidated. Four determinants have been defined by reactivity of a large panel of antipeptide monoclonal antibodies with short, overlapping peptides (7-28 amino acids), the immunizing peptide (36 amino acids), and the intact parent protein (the influenza virus hemagglutinin, HA). The majority of the antipeptide antibodies that also react strongly with the intact protein recognize one specific nine amino acid sequence. This immunodominant peptide determinant is located in the subunit interface in the HA trimeric structure. The relative inaccessibility of this site implies that antibody binding to the protein is to a more unfolded HA conformation. This antigenic determinant differs from those previously described for the hemagglutinin and clearly demonstrates the ability of synthetic peptides to generate antibodies that interact with regions of the protein not immunogenic or generally accessible when the protein is the immunogen.\n"

Extensive idiotypic cross-reactivity was demonstrated among monoclonal antibodies specific for distinct antigenic determinants on PR8 hemagglutinin (HA). The study of idiotypy of monoclonal antibodies against the same or overlapping antigenic determinants on B/Lee HA showed that these monoclonal antibodies may bear (a) a true individual idiotype not shared by other monoclonal antibodies, (b) idiotypes shared by few monoclonal antibodies, and (c) true cross-reactive idiotypes shared by all of these monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, no cross-reactive idiotypes were detectable among monoclonal antibodies to B/Lee HA and monoclonal antibodies to PR8 HA. Furthermore, we have shown that the anti-idiotype antibodies we used recognize determinants on monoclonal antibodies closely associated with antigenic binding sites. Finally, studies of the idiotypes expressed during primary and secondary antiviral HA responses of mice immunized with B/Lee virus revealed persistence of some idiotypes during both primary and secondary responses, whereas others were only expressed in the primary or secondary response.'"
